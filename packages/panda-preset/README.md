```

This package allows Pando to have a single source of truth for all things CSS. It contains the following:

- Design Tokens
- CSS Reset
- Themes
- Panda General Config
- CSS-in-JS API's

### Panda Preset General Function

The Panda Preset will be used in all Pando projects and thus internally used in the React package. It will be used to generate the CSS-in-JS/JSX API's and will be used to generate the Atomic CSS for the React package and build time within each local project.
